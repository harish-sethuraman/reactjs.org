    <!-- Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about
    half an hour preparing it, including the exact reproduction steps and a demo.

    If you're in a hurry or don't feel confident, it's fine to report bugs with
    less details, but this makes it less likely they'll get fixed soon.

    In either case, please use this template and fill in as many fields below as you can. -->

  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial
  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,
  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.

  Thanks for helping us help you!
